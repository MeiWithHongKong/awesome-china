# 2019 Hong Kong protests (DRAFT)

The **2019 Hong Kong protests**, also known as the **Antiâ€“Extradition Law Amendment Bill** or **Anti-ELAB movement**, are an ongoing series of demonstrations in Hong Kong which began with the aim to oppose the introduction of the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill proposed by the Hong Kong government. If enacted, the bill would allow local authorities to detain and extradite criminal fugitives who are wanted in territories with which Hong Kong does not currently have extradition agreements, including Taiwan and China. People were concerned that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to Chinese jurisdiction, undermining the autonomy of the region and its civil liberties. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands:

1. **Full withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process**
2. **Retraction of the characterisation of the protests as "riots"**
3. **Release and exoneration of arrested protesters**
4. **Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police behaviour**
5. **Universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections**

Demonstrations against the bill began in March and April and turned into continuing mass movements in June. 9 June saw the first ever use of artificial intelligence in measuring protesting crowds in the history of Hong Kong and 517,478 people were identified as they marched for the withdrawal of the bill. A day later, Chief Executive Carrie Lam vowed to push ahead with the extradition bill despite huge protests. On 12 June, the day on which the bill was scheduled for a second reading in the Legislative Council, the protests showed a sharp escalation in violence. Riot police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets, but protesters successfully stalled the functioning of the legislature. An even bigger march took place on 16 June, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters shifted the focus into the alleged excessive use of force by the police on 12 June. A scholar on-field gave an independent estimate of 500,000 to 800,000 protesters, while the organisers claimed that two million people participated.

July 1 marked the storming of the Legislative Council Complex and the vandalisation of central government symbols there. Subsequently, the protests have continued throughout the summer, escalating into increasingly violent confrontations involving the police, activists on both sides, suspected triad gangs, and local residents in all districts throughout the region. July 21 marked the Yuen Long attack where triads assaulted protesters and bystanders all night long, while police were accused of collusion by their intentional slow action.

Subsequent police operations and alleged misconduct prompted a general strike and city-wide protests on 5 August. About 1.7 million people (organisers' estimate) also attended a rally condemning police brutality on 18 August. Inspired by the Baltic Way, a human chain 50 kilometres long created the Hong Kong Way. There were also pro-police rallies that attracted hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents.

Lam suspended the extradition bill on June 15 and declared the bill "dead" on July 9, but fell short of a promise to withdraw it until September 4. However, she refused to concede to any of the other four demands. It should also be noted that the bill has yet to see complete withdrawal.

Large-scale demonstrations occurred on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, with an 18-year-old student protester shot by police on October 1. Attempting to curb protests, the Chief Executive in Council invoked the Emergency Regulations Ordinance on October 4 to implement an anti-mask law. Effective October 5, 2019, offenders risk one year imprisonment or a fine of HK$25,000. An application for judicial injunction of the anti-mask law was denied by court on the same night shortly before the new regulation took effect.
