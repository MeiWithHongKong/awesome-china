# List of Police Misconduct

**Note**: This list is still work-in-progress. I have only copied 6 out of 30+ videos so far.

This article will provide a list of police brutality and misconduct towards the Hong Kong protestors. The article will only show incidents where there is indisputable video evidence of police abuse.

Each incident has a GIF snippet along with a link to the full video. This is done to ensure the videos can be seen and shared by those living in China.
